## The goal of the program
When working with physical quantities, we are often not only interested in the value of each variable, but also in its quantity and unit. For example, a variable containing velocity can contain the value v = 7 660 m/s. The goal of the program is to allow developers to use helper types that 
allow this information to be stored in variables. The compiler does not allow the assignment, addition, or subtraction of two variables of different units, and is also able to derive the unit of multiple or quotient of two variables.
